**Note for Reviewers:**

- Replace all instances of `// TODO @Reviewers: add your own token` with your token.
  Without it, you'll have limited API access.
- Since this is a code challenge, I have left some comments explaining why and how I did certain things, as well as to show my line of thoughts. They are marked as `TODO @Reviewers`, so they are easier to spot.
